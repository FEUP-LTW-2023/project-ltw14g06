# Ticketing System Website

## Minimum

- Users
- [x] Register new account
- [x] Login and Logout
- [x] Edit their profile (at least name, username, password, and e-mail).

- Clients
- [x] Submit a new ticket optionally choosing a department (e.g., "Accounting").
- [x] List and track tickets they have submitted.
- [ ] Reply to inquiries (e.g., the agent asks for more details) about their tickets and add more information to already submitted tickets.

- Agents
- [ ] List tickets from their departments (e.g., "Accounting"), and filter them in different ways (e.g., by date, by assigned agent, by status, by priority, by hashtag).
- [ ] Change the department of a ticket (e.g., the client chose the wrong department).
- [x] Assign a ticket to themselves or someone else.
- [x] Change the status of a ticket. Tickets can have many statuses (e.g., open, assigned, closed); some may change automatically (e.g., ticket changes to "assigned" after being assigned to an agent).
- [ ] Edit ticket hashtags easily (just type hashtag to add (with autocomplete), and click to remove).
- [ ] List all changes done to a ticket (e.g., status changes, assignments, edits).
- [ ] Manage the FAQ and use an answer from the FAQ to answer a ticket.

- Admins
- [ ] Upgrade a client to an agent or an admin.
- [ ] Add new departments, statuses, and other relevant entities.
- [ ] Assign agents to departments.
- [ ] Control the whole system.

## Technologies used

- Languages
- [x] HTML
- [x] CSS
- [x] PHP
- [x] Javascript
- [x] Ajax/JSON
- [x] PDO/SQLite

- The website should be as secure as possible.
- [ ] SQL Injection prevention
- [ ] XSS attack protection
- [ ] CSRF attack protection
- [ ] Sound password storage principles

- Others
- [ ] The code should be organized and consistent
- [ ] The design does not need to be top-notch but should be clean and consistent throughout the site. 
- [ ] It should also work on mobile devices.
- [ ] Frameworks are **not allowed**.

## Additional Requirements (we do not need to implement all of these)
- [ ] Tickets can have documents attached to them (both by clients and agents).
- [ ] Admins should be able to see key performance indicators and other statistics (e.g., number of tickets closed by agent, number of open tickets per day).
- [ ] Agents can belong to more than one department.
- [ ] Agents can see a client's history.
- [ ] Agents can watch tickets not assigned to them (e.g., when transferring a ticket, the agent can check a box stating that he still wants to follow the ticket).
- [ ] Tickets can be merged together or marked as duplicates from another ticket.
- [ ] Tickets can have to-do lists that must be completed before the ticket is closed.
- [ ] Tasks can also be assigned to agents.
- [ ] If you prefer, you can create your own additional requirements.
